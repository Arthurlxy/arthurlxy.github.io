# About Me
I am a senior applied scientist at Amazon Prime Video.
My research interests are video understanding and multimedia understanding. 

Before Prime Video, I was a Senior research scientist at ByteDance and Senior Applied Scientist at Amazon AI, leading video related research and products. 
I am also one of the major contributor to open-source tools [GluonCV](https://cv.gluon.ai/) and tools [GluonMM](https://github.com/amazon-research/gluonmm).

I received my Ph.D. Degree (2018) at [Rutgers University](https://www.rutgers.edu/) supervised by Prof. Ivan Marsic.
I received my Bachelorâ€™s Degree (2013) at [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China](https://www.uestc.edu.cn/).
